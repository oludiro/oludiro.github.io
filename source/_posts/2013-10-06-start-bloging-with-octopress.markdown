Day one of using Octopress as my code blogging method.  
This site will be my place to do more posting on my learning journey to be a
better developer.  

Thanks to Kevin, [his website](http://kvz.io/blog/2012/09/25/blog-with-octopress/)
helped me on setting up my first octopress repo in GitHub.

The themes comes from [Shashank
Mehta](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade), I would think it will be
enough for now until I have my own time to tinker with the layout / design.

Now the next tasks would be moving some of my old blog post from my old website
and port it to markdown / jekyll. Once I finish with my old stuff, I should start
working on my side projects. [This
article](https://medium.com/busy-building-things/648223f673af) about _The Power of
Side Projects_ inspired me to be more productive and try and break new stuff while
learning from my mistakes.
