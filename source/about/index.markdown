I am senior-level _Front End Developer_ with skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have great experience in creating complex web applications using JavaScript frameworks such as [ AngularJS ](http://angularjs.org/), [ BackboneJS ](http://backbonejs.org/), [ knockoutJS ](http://knockoutjs.com/), and [ jQuery ](jquery.com).  

I have also used CLI development tools to help expedite the web development process, including [ node.js ](http://nodejs.org/), [ Yeoman ](http://yeoman.io/), [ SASS ](http://sass-lang.com/), [ Bower ](http://bower.io/), [ Grunt ](http://gruntjs.com/), [ git ](http://git-scm.com/), and [ Bootstrap ](http://getbootstrap.com/).  

I am always looking for new challenges to improve my coding skills and learn new web technologies.
